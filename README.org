* Overview

This is a work-in-progress project for an STM8 microcontroller powered
business card. I am using an STM8 alongside a OLED with a SSD1306
controller.

I've finished implementing most basic functionality (UART, I2C, etc)
and have begun working on the business card proper. There's still a
fair amount of work left to do. In particular, I need to implement
timers (instead of ~delay~), user input (debounced buttons), and a
low-power mode using interrupts. Of course, there's also more to be
done regarding the display itself!

I working to keep most of my code generic enough that I can reuse it
in future projects without needing to rework everything. It will act
as a miniature library of sorts for me to use. When that happens I
might move that to a different git project, and leave business card
specific code here.

can see that the player ship and lasers are functional and fully
animated. If you want to see the work that led up to this so far,
