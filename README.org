* Overview

This is a work-in-progress project for an STM8 microcontroller powered
business card. I will use an STM8 alongside a OLED with a SSD1306
controller.

I am currently implementing some basic functionality to assist with
development. For instance, using UART to send debug messages. =main.c=
might look more than a little rough in the meantime.

I plan on keeping most of my code generic enough that I can reuse it
in future projects without needing to rework everything. It will act
as a miniature library of sorts for me to use. When that happens I
might move that to a different git project, and leave business card
specific code here.
